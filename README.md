⚡ About

An interactive web application to visualize how data structures and algorithms work in real-time. Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks) to demonstrate core DOM manipulation and algorithm logic.

🚀 Features

  * **AVL Tree:** Auto-balancing (LL, RR, LR, RL rotations) with visual height updates.
  * **Binary Heap:** Min/Max heap operations with simultaneous Tree & Array views.
  * **Graph Algorithms:** Visualizations for BFS, DFS, MST (Prim/Kruskal), and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path.
  * **Hash Table:** Step-by-step collision handling (Chaining/Open Addressing).

🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **HTML5 & CSS3** (Layout & Styling)
  * **Vanilla JavaScript** (Logic & Animation)
  * **Canvas API** (Rendering)
